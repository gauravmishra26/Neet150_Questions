Problem: Valid Sudoku

You are given a 9 x 9 Sudoku board board. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.

Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.

Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.

Return true if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return false.

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

üß™ Example 1:

Input: board = 
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 ["."...] (truncated for brevity)
Output: true
1. Problem Statement
"You are given a 9 x 9 Sudoku board. Return true if the board is valid, otherwise return false. A valid board follows three rules: unique digits (1-9) in each row, each column, and each 3x3 sub-box."

üì¶ Input: A 9x9 grid of digits and . characters.

üéØ Output: true or false based on the validation rules.

2. Real-life Analogy
Imagine you are a quality control inspector for a Sudoku factory. Your job is to check if a board is properly made, even if it's incomplete. You need to verify three independent rules for the entire board at the same time:

Row Rule: You check each row, one at a time. As you go down a row, you note down the numbers you see. If you see a number you've already noted down for that row, you immediately fail the board.

Column Rule: You do the same for each column. As you go down a column, you note the numbers, and if you see a duplicate, you fail.

Box Rule: You also check each of the nine 3x3 boxes. For each box, you check for duplicate numbers.

The board is only valid if it passes all three checks simultaneously.

3. Thought Process ‚Äî Natural Logic
The problem requires us to check for duplicate numbers within three distinct groups:

9 rows

9 columns

9 sub-boxes

A number is only considered a duplicate if it appears more than once in the same group. This is a perfect use case for a Hash Set, which can efficiently check for the existence of an item.

A simple approach would be to iterate through the board and, for each cell, check its row, column, and sub-box for duplicates. However, this would involve a lot of redundant work. A more elegant and efficient solution is to make a single pass over the board and keep track of the numbers seen in each of the three types of groups.

4. Optimized Approach (One-Pass with Hash Sets)
üí° Core Idea: Use three collections of hash sets to track the numbers we encounter in each row, column, and sub-box in a single pass.

Data Structures:

row_sets: An array of 9 empty sets, one for each row.

col_sets: An array of 9 empty sets, one for each column.

box_sets: An array of 9 empty sets, one for each 3x3 sub-box.

Box Indexing: The key is how to map a (row, col) coordinate to a single box index from 0 to 8. The formula box_index = (row // 3) * 3 + (col // 3) works perfectly for a 9x9 grid.

Logic:

Initialize the three arrays of sets.

Iterate through the board with nested loops for row and col from 0 to 8.

For each cell board[row][col]:

If the cell contains a . (period), skip it.

Get the number num from the cell.

Calculate the box_index using the formula.

Check for duplicates: if num is already in row_sets[row], col_sets[col], or box_sets[box_index], return false.

If no duplicates are found, add num to all three sets: row_sets[row], col_sets[col], and box_sets[box_index].

If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return true.

‚è≥ Time Complexity: O(1)

Since the board size is fixed at 9x9, the number of operations is constant. We visit each of the 81 cells once.

üíæ Space Complexity: O(1)

The number of hash sets (3 x 9 = 27) and the maximum size of each set (at most 9 unique numbers) are constant. The memory usage does not scale with the input size.

5. Pseudocode (with explanation)
Function isValidSudoku(board):
    // Initialize three lists of sets, one for each validation type.
    rows = list of 9 empty sets
    columns = list of 9 empty sets
    boxes = list of 9 empty sets

    // Iterate through the board row by row and column by column.
    For row from 0 to 8:
        For col from 0 to 8:
            num = board[row][col]

            // Skip empty cells.
            If num is not ".":
                // Calculate the box index.
                box_index = (row / 3) * 3 + (col / 3)

                // Check for duplicates in the current row, column, and box sets.
                If num is in rows[row] or num is in columns[col] or num is in boxes[box_index]:
                    Return False
                
                // If no duplicates, add the number to all three sets.
                Add num to rows[row]
                Add num to columns[col]
                Add num to boxes[box_index]

    Return True

8. Explanation Side-by-Side (Meaning-Wise)
Step	What it does	Meaning
rows = defaultdict(set)	Creates a collection of sets for rows	"A notebook with 9 pages, one for each row, to track numbers I've seen in that row."
box_key = (r // 3, c // 3)	Identifies which 3x3 box a cell belongs to	"This cell is in the top-left box, so I'll write in that box's notebook page."
if num in ...	Checks for duplicates in three sets	"Have I already seen this number in this row? This column? This box?"
...add(num)	Adds the number to all sets	"I haven't seen this number yet, so I'll write it down in the notebook pages for this row, column, and box."
return True	All checks passed	"I've checked the whole board and found no rule violations."
