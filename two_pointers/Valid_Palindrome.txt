Problem: Valid Palindrome

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9).

üß™ Example 1:

Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
Output: true
Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.
1. Problem Statement
"Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false. A palindrome is case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters."

üì¶ Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

üéØ Output: true ‚Äî The processed string "wasitacaroracatisaw" reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. Real-life Analogy
Imagine you have a secret message written on a scroll, but it's full of spaces, punctuation, and some letters are capitalized while others are not. You know the real message is hidden, and it reads the same forwards and backwards.

To decode it, you first need to clean it up:

Filter: Ignore everything that isn't a letter or a number.

Normalize: Make all the letters the same case (e.g., lowercase).

Now that you have the clean message, you check if the first letter matches the last, the second matches the second-to-last, and so on, until you get to the middle. If all pairs match, the message is a palindrome!

3. Thought Process ‚Äî Natural Logic
This problem can be broken down into two main steps:

Preprocessing: Create a "clean" version of the string that contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters.

Validation: Check if this new, clean string is a palindrome.

A straightforward way to validate is to compare the string to its reverse. A more efficient way is to use two pointers to compare characters from the outside in. The two-pointer approach can be applied directly to the original string, avoiding the need for a separate preprocessing step and saving space.

4. Less Optimized Approach (Preprocessing and Reversing)
Logic:

Create a new, empty string or a list of characters.

Iterate through the input string s.

For each character, check if it's alphanumeric. If it is, convert it to lowercase and append it to your new string/list.

Join the list into a new string (if you used a list).

Check if this new string is equal to its reversed version.

‚è≥ Time Complexity: O(n) ‚Äî You iterate through the string to build the new one, and then the reversing and comparison also take time proportional to the string's length.

üíæ Space Complexity: O(n) ‚Äî You are creating a new string, which in the worst case can be as long as the original string.

5. Optimized Approach (Two Pointers)
üí° Core Idea: Use two pointers, one at each end of the original string, and move them inwards, skipping any non-alphanumeric characters, until they meet.

Logic:

Initialize a left pointer to the beginning of the string (index 0) and a right pointer to the end of the string (index n-1).

Use a while loop that continues as long as left < right.

Inside the loop, move the left pointer to the right as long as the character at s[left] is not alphanumeric.

Similarly, move the right pointer to the left as long as the character at s[right] is not alphanumeric.

If the pointers haven't crossed (left < right):

Compare the lowercase versions of the characters at s[left] and s[right].

If they don't match, return false.

If they match, move both pointers inward (left++, right--).

If the while loop finishes without returning false, it means all valid characters matched. Return true.

‚è≥ Time Complexity: O(n) ‚Äî We traverse the string once with the two pointers.

üíæ Space Complexity: O(1) ‚Äî We do not create any new strings or data structures whose size depends on the input.

6. Pseudocode (with explanation)
Function isPalindrome(s):
    left = 0
    right = length of s - 1

    While left < right:
        // Move left pointer to the first alphanumeric character
        While left < right and character at s[left] is not alphanumeric:
            left = left + 1

        // Move right pointer to the first alphanumeric character from the right
        While left < right and character at s[right] is not alphanumeric:
            right = right - 1

        // Compare the characters (after converting to lowercase)
        If lowercase of s[left] is not equal to lowercase of s[right]:
            Return False

        // Move pointers inward for the next comparison
        left = left + 1
        right = right - 1

    // If the loop completes, it's a palindrome.
    Return True

Step	What it does	Meaning
left = 0, right = n-1	Initializes two pointers	"I'll put one finger on the first letter and one on the last."
while left < right	Loop condition	"Keep checking as long as my fingers haven't met."
while ... not isalnum()	Skips non-alphanumeric chars	"Slide my finger past any spaces, commas, or other junk."
if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower()	Compares characters	"Do the first meaningful letter and the last meaningful letter match?"
left++, right--	Moves pointers inward	"They match, so I'll move my fingers in one step each to check the next pair."
return True	All pairs matched	"All the letters I checked matched, so it's a palindrome!"
